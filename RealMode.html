    <h2>üõ´ 1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is a quickstart guide for Airline Manager 4 (AM4) players who want to grow fast in Realism mode and not only ‚Äî from a fresh reset to level 5+ and a rank under 12,000 ‚Äî in about 4 to 5 hours of focused gameplay.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> "Quick" means 4‚Äì5 hours of real-time play with at least 70% of your attention on the game. If you can't commit that, it's best to wait until you can.
    </div>
    <p>
      This is not a full game guide. For complete help, check the in-game <strong>Help ‚Üí Game Help ‚Üí Guide</strong>. This guide focuses on strategies and insights that the official guide leaves for players to discover on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've already built up an airline to this level, there's no need to reset. Just keep playing and enjoy your progress. But if you're starting fresh in Realism mode, this guide is for you.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="reset-and-hub">
    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è 2. Resetting Your Account & Choosing a Hub</h2>
    <p>
      To start fresh in Realism mode, go to <strong>Settings ‚Üí Reset Account</strong>. This will wipe all progress, aircraft, routes, and achievements. Only do this if you're sure ‚Äî it's a clean slate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players often reset after experimenting in Easy mode and wanting a more challenging experience. Your reasons are your own, but once you reset, you're ready to build smarter from the ground up.
    </p>

    <h3>Choosing a Hub</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a large airport with strong demand and good geographic reach.</li>
      <li><strong>Orlando International</strong> is a solid choice:
        <ul>
          <li>Central location for US and South America</li>
          <li>Reachable from London Heathrow with a 737-800</li>
          <li>Consistent demand across many short and medium routes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Make sure your hub has at least 10 nearby airports (under 300km) with high Y class demand (500+).</li>
      <li>If not, consider resetting early or relocating your base later in the game.</li>
      <li>Bonus tip: choose a region you‚Äôre familiar with ‚Äî knowing airport names helps when picking routes manually.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="starter-aircraft">
    <h2>‚úàÔ∏è 3. Starter Aircraft & First Route Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the game, you'll be given a starter aircraft. Either option works, but the <strong>737-800</strong> is generally preferred for its range, speed, and earning potential.
    </p>

    <h3>Choosing Your First Route</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If the game suggests a long route, cancel and retry until you get a short one.</li>
      <li>Wait for your starter plane to return to your hub before activating the 4x speedup bonus.</li>
      <li>Short routes earn more money as long as you're actively dispatching flights on arrival.</li>
      <li>Example: Orlando to Sarasota Bradenton is short enough; Orlando to Melbourne, FL is too short.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Short Routes Matter</h3>
    <p>
      Short routes allow for frequent departures, which means more revenue per hour ‚Äî especially during the 4x speedup window. The key is to keep your aircraft moving constantly.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="cessna-strategy">
    <h2>üõ©Ô∏è 4. Cessna Tips & Achievements</h2>
    <p>
      When the game requires you to buy a Cessna, configure it with a single <strong>First Class seat</strong>. This triggers the $100K bonus for your first First Class passenger and makes the aircraft surprisingly profitable ‚Äî as long as your reputation is above 50% and you're flying short routes.
    </p>

    <h3>Achievement Farming</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ferry:</strong> Launch a flight with no passengers ‚Äî the Cessna is the cheapest way to do this.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Recall a launched flight ‚Äî again, use the Cessna to minimize cost.</li>
      <li>Try launching a Ferry flight and recalling it immediately ‚Äî this may unlock both achievements in one step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operational Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don‚Äôt sell the Cessna if you‚Äôre short-cycling it with frequent departures ‚Äî it can break even or turn a small profit.</li>
      <li>If you're flying less frequently (e.g. once every few hours), fuel costs may outweigh revenue ‚Äî in that case, feel free to sell it.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt overthink where to sell ‚Äî the price difference between markets is minimal (usually under $3,000).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="marketing-campaigns">
    <h2>üì¢ 5. Marketing Campaigns</h2>
    <p>
      Marketing can be powerful ‚Äî but timing matters. Early in the game, <strong>regular marketing</strong> is not a great return on investment unless you're departing more than 250 empty seats per hour.
    </p>

    <h3>Eco-Marketing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eco campaigns are almost always worth it, even early on.</li>
      <li>They help fill seats and boost reputation at a low cost.</li>
      <li>Only skip eco-marketing if you're flying fewer than 200 empty seats in the next 12 hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Top-Tier Campaigns</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start a top-tier 4-hour campaign just before activating your 4x speedup bonus.</li>
      <li>This ensures maximum ridership and profit during your most productive window.</li>
      <li>Marketing costs scale slowly as your airline grows ‚Äî so early investment pays off.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As your airline expands, regular marketing becomes more viable. If you're growing fast, you'll likely benefit from full campaigns within a couple of days.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="fleet-expansion">
    <h2>üíº 6. Fleet Expansion</h2>
    <p>
      Once you've got your starter aircraft earning consistently, it's time to grow your fleet. You‚Äôll have a few options, but the fastest early-game growth comes from building a fleet of <strong>ATR-42-320s</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Why ATR-42-320?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Affordable and efficient for short routes</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and low operating costs</li>
      <li>Perfect match for high-frequency, short-distance flying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Early Aircraft Options</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BAe 146-300</strong> or <strong>DC-9-10</strong> are viable, but slower growth</li>
      <li>ATR-42-320s scale better with top-tier marketing campaigns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Important Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Save enough cash for a <strong>top-tier 4-hour marketing campaign</strong> before buying your fleet</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt launch newly ordered aircraft until you‚Äôre ready to activate speedup</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt relaunch your starter jet until speedup is active</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In this early stage, configure all aircraft with <strong>Y class (Economy)</strong> seating ‚Äî it‚Äôs the most efficient and cost-effective setup. Focus on routes with high Y class demand and keep your planes flying constantly.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="achievements-speedup">
    <h2>üèÜ 7. Achievements & Speedup Bonus</h2>
    <p>
      One of the key early-game prizes is the <strong>4-hour 4x speedup</strong, which you unlock by earning 5 achievements. These are easy to get if you know what to aim for.
    </p>

    <h3>Easy Achievements to Target</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertiser:</strong> Launch a top-tier 4-hour marketing campaign</li>
      <li><strong>Aircraft Expert:</strong> Buy any aircraft</li>
      <li><strong>Airline Owner:</strong> Automatically granted when you start the game</li>
      <li><strong>Capital Operator:</strong> Run a route to a major airport or capital city</li>
      <li><strong>Ferry:</strong> Launch a flight with no passengers (use the Cessna)</li>
      <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Recall a launched flight (Cessna is cheapest)</li>
      <li><strong>Map Operator:</strong> Change the map stack and enable dark mode</li>
      <li><strong>Stopping Up:</strong> Add a stopover when setting a route (no need to fly it)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Claiming the Speedup</h3>
    <p>
      Once your starter aircraft has landed and you've earned 5 achievements, go to the checklist and claim your <strong>4-hour 4x speedup</strong>. Activate it only when you're ready to commit to focused gameplay ‚Äî this is your most productive window.
    </p>

    <h3>Optimizing the Speedup Window</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Depart aircraft on short, single-hop routes</li>
      <li>Avoid changing routes during speedup ‚Äî reconfiguring costs money</li>
      <li>Assign only one aircraft per destination to avoid saturating demand</li>
      <li>Order more aircraft as soon as you can afford them</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="short-routes">
    <h2>üìç 8. Ultra-Short Routes & Demand Management</h2>
    <p>
      For the Quickstart strategy, you want routes that are as short as the game allows ‚Äî ideally under <strong>250 km</strong>. These routes allow for rapid cycling and maximum profit during speedup.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding Good Short Routes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use manual airport selection ‚Äî research only filters down to 500 km.</li>
      <li>Look for airports with Y class demand over 500.</li>
      <li>If your hub doesn‚Äôt offer at least 10 good airports under 300 km, consider switching hubs early.</li>
      <li>Example: Orlando to Sarasota Bradenton is viable; Orlando to Melbourne FL is too short.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Route Saturation Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Depart flights as soon as they land ‚Äî keep aircraft moving.</li>
      <li>Only assign one aircraft per destination to avoid exhausting demand.</li>
      <li>If demand runs out, reroute to another short, high-demand airport.</li>
      <li>Second runs on new routes usually turn a profit immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fleet Scaling During Speedup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Order more aircraft as soon as you can afford them.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt worry about fuel or CO‚ÇÇ credits ‚Äî they won‚Äôt run out in the first 4 hours.</li>
      <li>If either drops below 500,000 during speedup, you‚Äôre doing exceptionally well ‚Äî consider slowing purchases and stockpiling fuel.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="game-pace">
    <h2>üîÅ 9. Game Pace & Fleet Synchronization</h2>
    <p>
      Not everyone can play nonstop ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. Once the 4-hour speedup window ends, you can shift to a more relaxed rhythm while still growing efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Slower Play Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Depart aircraft every 3.5 to 4 hours ‚Äî this balances gameplay with real life.</li>
      <li>Research airports under 1930 km with runways over 6,500 ft and sort by Y class demand.</li>
      <li>Assign ATR-42-320s to the top 10 routes for consistent income.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fleet Synchronization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Upgrade ATR-42-320s for <strong>+10% fuel efficiency</strong> first, then <strong>+10% speed</strong>.</li>
      <li>Speed upgrades help align flight durations under 3h45m ‚Äî ideal for 2 departures per 4-hour campaign.</li>
      <li>Optional: adjust speed factors so all aircraft fly in sync ‚Äî purely aesthetic, but satisfying.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Syncing your fleet isn‚Äôt necessary for performance, but it can make route management easier and more enjoyable. It‚Äôs a personal touch that adds rhythm to your airline‚Äôs operations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="profit-analysis">
    <h2>üí∞ 10. Profit Analysis ‚Äì Short vs Long Routes</h2>
    <p>
      Short routes are the backbone of early-game profitability, especially during speedup. Here's a breakdown of how they compare to longer routes in terms of revenue and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h3>Short Route Example (with marketing)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fare: $9,102</li>
      <li>Fuel: 1,693 lbs ‚Üí ~$1,490 cost (assuming $800/1,000 lbs + 10% CO‚ÇÇ)</li>
      <li><strong>Profit:</strong> ~$7,612 per cycle</li>
      <li>During 4x speedup: ~10-minute cycles ‚Üí ~$11,418/hour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long Route Example (with marketing)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fare: $32,103</li>
      <li>Fuel: 18,572 lbs ‚Üí ~$16,343 cost</li>
      <li><strong>Profit:</strong> ~$15,760 per cycle</li>
      <li>Cycle time: ~4 hours ‚Üí ~$3,940/hour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Without Full Marketing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fare drops to ~$19,575</li>
      <li>Costs drop slightly (~$16,000), but profit falls to ~$3,575</li>
      <li>Hourly profit: ~$894 ‚Äî nearly <strong>13x less</strong> than short cycling with full marketing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bottom line: short routes with full marketing are nearly 3x more profitable per hour than long routes ‚Äî and up to 13x more profitable than long routes without marketing. If you're actively managing departures, short cycles are the way to go.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="midgame-aircraft">
    <h2>‚úàÔ∏è 11. Favorite Mid-Game Aircraft</h2>
    <p>
      As you move beyond the starter fleet and early-game grind, certain aircraft stand out for their efficiency, range, and upgrade potential. These picks help bridge the gap between short-haul spam and long-haul dominance.
    </p>

    <h3>Top Mid-Game Aircraft Picks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ERJ 145LR:</strong> Cheap but not too cheap. Fast and long-range for its price bracket. Can handle up to ~4-hour routes with stopovers. Efficient enough to avoid losses in most scenarios.</li>
      <li><strong>Tu 334-220:</strong> Slightly larger and more efficient. Also ~4-hour range with stopovers. Short runway capable, giving access to more route options. Great stepping stone before 737-800s.</li>
      <li><strong>737-800:</strong> Versatile and powerful. Can run 6+ hour legs in easy mode. Purchased models fly slightly slower than the starter one, but both can be upgraded for +10% speed.</li>
      <li><strong>B787-8:</strong> Excellent range and fuel efficiency. Can run 11‚Äì12 hour hops, allowing for 2 departures per day instead of 4. Keeps flying while short-range planes sit idle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stopovers vs Direct Routes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stopovers offer strategic flexibility but require more planning and micromanagement.</li>
      <li>Direct routes are easier to research, configure, and maintain ‚Äî especially with a growing fleet.</li>
      <li>Many players enjoy stopovers early on, but eventually shift to direct routes for simplicity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Upgrade Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Move up to the next aircraft tier when you can afford one in less than a day.</li>
      <li>Sell smaller planes once your fleet approaches max capacity and you‚Äôre ready for long-haul efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="progression-wrapup">
    <h2>üìà 12. Progression Strategy & Wrap-Up</h2>
    <p>
      As your airline grows, your strategy should evolve. The goal is to keep upgrading aircraft and routes in sync with your income and capacity. Here's how to keep momentum going.
    </p>

    <h3>Progression Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Move up to the next aircraft tier when you can afford one in less than a day of earnings.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt hoard cash ‚Äî reinvest into better aircraft and more efficient routes.</li>
      <li>Sell smaller planes once your fleet approaches max capacity and you‚Äôre ready to scale into long-haul operations.</li>
      <li>Use aircraft with longer range and fewer daily departures to reduce micromanagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Endgame Transition</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start looking at wide-body aircraft like the <strong>B787-8</strong> or <strong>A380</strong> for intercontinental routes.</li>
      <li>Focus on high-demand, long-range routes that match your upgraded fleet.</li>
      <li>Configure seating to match demand ‚Äî mixed Y/J/F setups can boost revenue if tailored correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
